		<h2>How to get to Kalanggaman Island</h2>
		<br><br>
		<h1>1. Fly to Ormoc City. The city of Ormoc is the gateway to western Leyte, and flying is the most convenient way to get there. The city has its own domestic airport, though flights to or from Manila are not yet available. Cebu Pacific Air is the only airline flying to Ormoc. The flight is operated by Cebgo. For those coming from Manila or abroad, you’ll need to arrange a trip to Cebu City first, then connect a Cebu Pacific flight to Ormoc. There are other ways of getting there, which we will discuss below.<br><br>
2. Travel by bus or van to Palompon. From the airport, go to the Ormoc van and bus terminal found just behind the pier across Ormoc City Park. Travel time from Ormoc to Palompon usually takes an hour and a half, depending on your route and mode of transportation. Fare for the van is from PHP 100-150. Bus fares are tad cheaper: PHP 50-60, but since buses stop over several towns your travel time will take significantly longer. Once you arrive at Palompon, your drop-off point should be the Town Ecotourism office.<br><br>
3. Pay the fees at the Ecotourism Office. It’s located at the Freedom Park, just beside the Municipal Town Hall. Access to the island requires an entrance fee; the local government use it to fund the island’s conservation efforts. The fee varies. We’ll list down the fees in another section below. (Scroll down!) All fees can be paid at the Ecotourism office.<br><br>
4. Get a boat. Aside from the conservation fee, there’s also the boat rental. Rental fees can go from PHP 3000 pesos for 15-seaters to PHP 4000 for the larger 30-capacity motorboats. There’s more value for those traveling in large groups. You can hire a whole boat for yourself, or wait for other tourists to fill it up.</h1>
<br><br>
<h3>The Visayan Sea is a fairly busy waterway, and many vessels travel through it: fishing boats, fastcraft liners, even large interisland cargo ships. A couple of friendly fishermen waved at us as we navigated through. Finally, after an hour or so of nothing but the blue and the sound of the boat’s motor, we saw the island. I told you earlier about patience. Well, good things come to those who wait. Kalanggaman is nothing short of a spectacle.</h3>
<br><br>
<h2>Other Ways to Get There</h2><br><br>
<h3><center>Flying to Ormoc City is the fastest and the most comfortable way to get to Kalanggaman Island, but there are other ways too.</h3></center><br>
<h1>* Via Tacloban. You can also fly to Tacloban and take a 4- to 5-hour van ride to the town of Palompon. Once in Palompon, visit the Eco-Tourism Office and get a boat, as explained above.<br>
* Via Cebu by boat. You may also travel by sea to Palompon from Cebu. From Mactan Airport, take a cab to Pier 3, where you may board ship to Palompon (P500, 4 hours). But this will take a lot more time.</h1><br>
<h3>In our case, we flew Cebu Pacific Air to Ormoc City via Cebu and stayed a bit in Ormoc, which we also recommend. Ormoc has its own set of attractions! Wee arrived at Ormoc during the height of the city’s Piña Festival, and we spent a couple of days in the city to partake in the festivities. By festivities we meant booze, tons of lechon, and of course, pineapples. Hectares of them. No wonder everyone was wobbly the morning we’re scheduled for Kalanggaman.</h3><br>
